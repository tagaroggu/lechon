# lechon (WIP does not work in current state)
My tiny buildless vue setup. Opinionated, not posted to NPM.

# Wait, why though?
Honestly, this is just like a simple little thing that I just felt like making for myself. It is a bundle of Vue and htm, specifically without Vue's template strings compiler, hence the use of htm, a drop-in replacement for JSX that doesn't need a build step.

# Use cases
Just like anything you could make with a build step, but now without one. Make a github pages site with this and unpkg or something else so that you don't need a build step. Vue and htm are bundled into the builds so all you need to do is download this repo. Or, use it as a dependency to a project with npm, too.
## This is not posted to npm by me. To use with npm, run `npm install tagaroggu/lechon`
